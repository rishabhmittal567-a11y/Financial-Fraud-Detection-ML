# Financial-Fraud-Detection-ML
This is a project based on comparison of ML Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and AdaBoost in financial fraud detection.
## Overview
This project detects fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost

## Techniques Used
- Class imbalance handling
- Feature engineering
- One-hot encoding
- Model comparison using ROC-AUC
- Sampling for large-scale data

## Results
XGBoost achieved the best performance with the highest ROC-AUC and a strong balance between precision and recall.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
